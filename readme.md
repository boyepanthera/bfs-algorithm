# Algorithms

## Search Algorithms (Python, Js and Ts) + More languages soon

This repository contains code for BFS search algorithms and it was written to be used in a tutorial both text and video tutorial explaining the USAGE of BFS search algorithm. It contains code implementation in Javascript, Python and Typescript language.

There are five files in this repository right now:

1. JavaScript implementation file
2. Optimised JavaScript implementation file
3. Typescript implementation file
4. Optimised Typescript implementation file
5. Python implementation file

You can write your own optimised python implementation fil

**Note** _It is easier to run the Js and Ts algorithms with bun runtime as it has builtin support for typescript and you won't need to do any tsconfig or typescript configuration._

### Run commands

1. Breadth-first search Js code ()
   `bun run bfs/bfs.js`

2. Breadth-first search optimised Js code ()
   `bun run bfs/optbfs.js`

3. Breadth-first search Ts code ()
   `bun run bfs/bfs.ts`

4. Breadth-first search Optimised Ts code ()
   `bun run bfs/optbfs.ts`

5. Breadth-first search Python code ()
   `python bfs/bfs.py`
